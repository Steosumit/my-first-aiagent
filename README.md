# Overview
This repo consists of some of my works as I learnt building AI agents from cratch. Feel free to read the code if you want to understand how agents work in details

# Features
- Well documented: I tried writing all the intricate things going inside head
- Working: coding was assisted with the course from FreeCodeCamp: https://github.com/iamvaibhavmehra/LangGraph-Course-freeCodeCamp/tree/main/Agents
- Covers all the basics: from graphs to RAG

# How to use
- Download or clone the repo
- Make a .env file with GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your api key>
- Install the requirement as and when needed

# P.S
Please be careful while importing modules as many have same names but do totally different functions. I struggled with debugging with this for hours, so :)

# License
Free for learners LOL!
